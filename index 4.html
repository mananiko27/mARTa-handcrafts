        <h2>Martha</h2>
        <p>
            This space is born from love, devotion, and an eternal bond. <img src="art1.jpg" alt="Peach branch" class="inline"/>
            It is dedicated to my sweet, blissful, strong-minded, and deeply artistic daughter, Martha —
            eternally 8 years old. She left behind a world of inspiration which lives on in every piece I create.
        </p>
        <p>
            Her sense of color, shape, and beauty ran deep. Her drawings, her crafts, her playful eye – all were inimitable.
            Yet I dare and try, with her spirit in mind. <img src="art2.jpg" alt="Sunflowers" class="inline"/>
        </p>
        <p>
            This space isn’t about perfection. It’s about imagination, joy and simple forms that radiate warmth,
            color and comfort. It’s a little handmade world, simple and sincere, that speaks to anyone who still carries
            that childlike sense of wonder. <img src="art3.jpg" alt="Tree artwork" class="inline"/>
        </p>
        <p>
            Every piece in mARTa is crafted with care, heart, and a spark of childhood magic. From Christmas trees
            in every shape and form, to vibrant flowers, to playful abstractions—these creations are lively, heartfelt,
            and full of emotions.
        </p>
        <p>
            My hope is to create decorations that evoke new sensations, yet take you back — to joy, to memories,
            to that carefree feeling. I hope what you find here can enlighten and enrich your eyesight,
            bring warmth to your heart and rekindle memories. <img src="art6.jpg" alt="Abstract face" class="inline"/>
